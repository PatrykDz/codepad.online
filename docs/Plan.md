# Master plan for CodePad.online project





## Main user experience

**Quickly share code snippets in multiple programming languages**

**Make it long time storage for quick notes of code and links**



How to achieve that:

1. Go straight to the notepad with some default language being set, like "TypeScript"
2. Make this a PWA, so that users don't have to wait for it to load, and make it ultra snappy.





## I'll send this via codepad.online instead of Slack/Skype because:

* Because it is integrated with my system and slack, so that it is faster to do so instead of other way.



## Specfic design decisions

Choosing the current programming language should be possible by selecting the language in dropdown by the document's name. This should look like a colorfull tag with an \/ arrow.
